                    -Your Excellency Prime Minister Rabuka,
                        Delegates from both countries,
                        Friends from the media,
                        Namskaar!
                        Bula Vinaka!
                        I warmly welcome Prime Minister Rabuka and his delegation to India.
                        In 2014, an Indian Prime Minister visited Fiji after 33 years. I feel very happy and proud to have had this good fortune.
                        At the time, we launched the Forum for India–Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC). This initiative has not only strengthened India–Fiji relations but also our ties with the entire Pacific region. Today, with Prime Minister Rabuka’s visit, we are writing a new chapter in our partnership.
                        Friends,
                        India and Fiji share a deep bond of friendship. In the 19th century, over sixty thousand indentured Indian brothers and sisters went to Fiji, and contributed to its prosperity through their hard work and dedication. They have added new colour to the social and cultural diversity of Fiji, and have continuously strengthened the unity and integrity of the nation.
                        And through all this, they also remained connected to their roots and preserved their culture. The tradition of Fiji's Ramayana Mandali is a living proof of this. I welcome the announcement of 'Girmit Day' by Prime Minister Rabuka. This is a tribute to our shared history. It is a tribute to the memories of our past generations.
                        Friends,
                        In our extensive discussions today, we made several important decisions. We believe that only a healthy nation can be a prosperous one. Therefore, a 100-bed super specialty hospital will be built in Suva. Dialysis units and sea ambulances will also be sent. Jan Aushadhi Kendras will be opened to provide affordable, high-quality medicines to every home. To ensure that no one is held back in the race for their dreams, a ‘Jaipur Foot’ camp will also be organized in Fiji.
                        In the field of agriculture, cowpea seeds sent from India are growing very well in Fiji’s soil. India will also gift 12 agri-drones and 2 mobile soil testing labs. We applaud the Fijian government for approving Indian Ghee in Fiji.
                        Friends,
                        We have decided to strengthen our cooperation in defence and security. An action plan has been prepared for this. India will provide cooperation in training and equipment, to improve Fiji’s maritime security. We are also ready to share our experience in cyber security and data protection.
                        We are unanimous that terrorism is a huge challenge for the entire humanity. We express our gratitude to Prime Minister Rabuka and the Government of Fiji for their cooperation and support in our fight against terrorism.
                        Friends,
                        Sports is a field that connects people from the ground to the mind. Rugby in Fiji and Cricket in India are examples. Waisale Serevi, the ‘Star of Rugby Sevens,’ coached the Indian rugby team. Now, an Indian coach is set to take the Fiji cricket team to new heights.
                        We have decided to send Indian teachers to teach Hindi and Sanskrit in the University of Fiji. Fijian Pandits will come to India for leaning, and take part in the Gita Mahotsav. This will deepen our connection from language to culture.
                        Friends,
                        Climate change poses a critical threat to Fiji. In this context, we are working together in the field of renewable energy, particularly solar energy. We stand together in the International Solar Alliance, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, and the Global Biofuels Alliance. Going forward, we will also extend our cooperation to strengthen Fiji’s disaster response capabilities.
                        Friends,
                        In our cooperation with the Pacific Island nations, we see Fiji as a hub. Both our countries strongly support a free, open, inclusive, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific. Prime Minister’s vision of "Oceans of Peace” is indeed a very positive and forward-looking approach. We warmly welcome Fiji’s association with India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative.
                        India and Fiji may be oceans apart, but our aspirations sail in the same boat.
                        We are fellow travellers in the development journey of the Global South. Together, we are partners in shaping a world order where independence, ideas, and identity of the Global South are accorded due respect.
                        We believe that no voice should be ignored, and no nation should be left behind!
                        Excellency,
                        From the Indian Ocean to the Pacific, our partnership is a bridge across the seas. It is rooted in Veilomani, and built on trust and respect.
                        Your visit further strengthens this enduring bond. We deeply value your friendship.
                        Vinaka Vakalevu!
